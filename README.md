# flask-on-docker

In this project, I created a fully working web service using a modified version of the Instagram tech stack. In this web service, the user can upload an image (http://localhost:3137/upload) and then they can view their image from a new link (http://localhost:3137/media/IMAGE_FILE_NAME)

This is an example of the web service works:
